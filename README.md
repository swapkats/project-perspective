## Philosophy

> Knowledge wants to be spread. It should not be constrained at any cost.

Project Perspective is a free open source project whose single aim is to spread knowledge without any constraints. Like archive.org it tries to provide free public access to knowledge through mind maps.

Why Mindmaps? Mind maps are efficient for learning. Mind maps work in a way that is very natural to how our brains learn and store new information. They help us access more regions of our brain like linguistic and creative regions to improve learning experience.

Perpective aims to be an upgrade over mind map in a sense that that prepective mind maps are designed to utilise more of our brain by simulating an environment natural to how our brains developed over time. With perpersitive maps we'll be able to add extra dimension to mind maps, letting the user play with information like our monkey ancestors did.

It aims to move away from slow auditorial learning process like books to step into a new generation learning medium by making use of all auditory, visual and kinesthetic mediums of learning.

Finally Perspective.wiki is a public wiki anyone can edit the mind maps and maintain them just like wikipedia.
